abstract: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and its tautomer hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) are
  relevant for extraterrestrial chemistry and possible relation to the origin of
  biomolecules. Several processes and reactions involving these molecules depend
  on their intermolecular interactions that can lead to aggregates and liquids
  especially due to the hydrogen bonds. It is thus important to comprehend, to
  describe, and to quantify their hydrogen bonds, mainly their nature and the
  cooperativity effects. A systematic study of all linear complexes up to
  pentamers of HCN and HNC is presented. CCSD (T)/CBS energy calculations, with
  and without basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrections for energies and
  geometries, provided a suitable set of benchmarks. Approximated methods based
  on the density functional theory (DFT) such as BP86, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP,
  CAM-B3LYP with and without dispersion corrections and long-range...
